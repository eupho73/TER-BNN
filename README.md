# CAT Bonds Price Modeling Using Bayesian Neural Networks: the Example of Earthquake in Japan

## Project Description

This project aims at predicting annual costs related to earthquake in Japan. The end goal is to price a parametric CAT Bond using financial risk variables such as LIBOR rate, inflation rate and risk-free rate and geological risks such as magnitude and depth. The models used will revolve around the use of Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN) with mainly PyTorch and Pyro libraries.
